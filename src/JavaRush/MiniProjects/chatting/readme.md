Надо написать программу, в которой 6 тредов: Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel и Ross разыгрывают в консоли сценки из ситкома.
Каждый печатает свое имя и реплику. Например, так:

Joey: Hey, hey.

Chandler: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey.

Chandler: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?

Joey: Yes, I am. As of today, i am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.

Chandler: Thats so funny, cause i am thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.

Phoebe: What were you modeling for?

Joey: You know those posters for the City Free Clinic?

Monica: oh, wow, so you`re gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?

Phoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.

Chandler: Do you know which one you are gonna be?

Joey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)

Chandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

Joey: Thanks.
